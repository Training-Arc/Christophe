# Lean and QuantConnect Setup Guide

## What is Lean?

Lean is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built by QuantConnect. It's designed to be the foundation for quantitative trading and research. Lean can handle multiple asset classes and is used for backtesting, live trading, and research.

## What is QuantConnect?

QuantConnect is a browser-based algorithmic trading platform that allows you to write, test, and deploy trading algorithms. It uses Lean as its core engine and provides a cloud-based infrastructure for running your algorithms.
