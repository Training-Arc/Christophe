Video Editor Application (In Progress)
Overview
This is a Python-based video editor application built using PyQt5. It allows users to load videos, display video timelines, audio waveforms, and offers cutting, playback, and basic editing capabilities. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing and synchronizing video and audio tracks.

Features
Video Playback: Play and pause video files within the editor.
Video Timeline and Audio Waveform: Visual representation of the video timeline and audio waveform to facilitate precise editing.
Cutting and Splitting: Allows users to cut video and audio segments with synchronized cutting for both tracks.
Zoom and Time Ruler: Zoom in/out of the timeline and display time ruler markers for easy navigation.
Undo/Redo: Supports undo and redo functionality for editing actions.
Basic and Advanced Tools: Different toolsets for both basic and advanced video editing features.
AI Feature Integration (Placeholder): Placeholder for future AI tools like transcription and video enhancement.
